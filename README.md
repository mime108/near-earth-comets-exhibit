Interactive infographic created for, visualizing comet data with at least three attributes, designed as a unique museum-style exhibit.

# Near-Earth Comets – Custom D3.js Visualization Exhibit

This repository contains a **custom D3.js visualization**.  
The goal was to design a **museum-style exhibit** that communicates insights from the **Near-Earth Comets dataset** in a visually engaging and interactive way for visitors.

## ✨ Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** Near-Earth Comets   
- **Notes:** The dataset includes attributes such as comet name, discovery date, orbital parameters, and distance from Earth. Only a subset of cleaned and relevant data points (≥30 comets) are included for the exhibit.

## 🎨 Visualization Design
- **Marks:** Custom comet-shaped glyphs  
- **Channels:**  
  - **Position (X/Y):** Orbital distance from Earth and inclination  
  - **Size:** Comet size (diameter)  
  - **Color:** Discovery decade  
- **Interactions:** Hover over each comet to see a tooltip with its name, discovery date, and other key attributes.  

This design highlights patterns in comet discovery, orbital characteristics, and size distributions, making complex astronomical data accessible and visually interesting for museum visitors.

## 🌀 Custom Visualization Category
- **Category:** Combinatorial  
- **Justification:** This visualization combines a spatial representation of comet orbits with glyph-based size and color encoding. The design merges multiple visual channels and interactions to create a unique exhibit rather than a standard chart.
